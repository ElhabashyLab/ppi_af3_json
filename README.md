**Running AlphaFold3 for Protein–Protein Interaction Modeling**
This repository provides a step-by-step guide for running AlphaFold3 to model protein–protein interactions using HPC resources.


  
## **1. AlphaFold 3 Repository**

The original AlphaFold 3 implementation can be found here:
(https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3)
This repository contains all the necessary code required for AlphaFold 3 inference.
Accessing Model Parameters
  
To use AlphaFold 3, you must request access to the official model parameters.
Follow the instructions in the section below:
(https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3?tab=readme-ov-file#obtaining-model-parameters)
Access is granted at the sole discretion of Google DeepMind. Requests are typically reviewed within 2–3 business days.
**Note**: AlphaFold 3 model parameters may only be used if obtained directly from Google DeepMind and are subject to their terms of use.
   
   
## **2. MPCDF Account Setup (if applicable)**

This step is only relevant for employees of the Max Planck Society (MPG).
If you already have an MPCDF account, you may skip this section.
If you are not a member of the MPG, you can also skip steps 2 and 3 and instead use any other HPC system you have access to.
If you do not already have an MPCDF account, please follow the instructions here:
(https://docs.mpcdf.mpg.de/faq/account.html)
   
   
## **3. Running AlphaFold 3 on MPCDF (Raven Cluster)**

AlphaFold 3 is available on the Raven cluster at MPCDF.
To load the AlphaFold module and configure the required environment (including model weights), follow the official documentation:
https://docs.mpcdf.mpg.de/bnb/217.html
   
   
## **4. Prepare Input List of Protein–Protein Interactions**

Before running AlphaFold 3, you need to prepare an input file specifying the protein–protein interactions to be modeled.

a. The input file in CSV formate CSV must contain the following columns:
- **Column**, **Name**,	**Description**
- **job_name**	Unique name for the modeling job (used to create output directory and files).
- **uid1**	UniProt ID of the first protein.
- **uid2**	UniProt ID of the second protein.
- **uid1_copies**	Number of copies of the first protein to include to be modeled.
- **uid2_copies**	Number of copies of the second protein to include to be modeled.

Example:
```csv
job_name,uid1,uid2,uid1_copies,uid2_copies
Job1,P69905,P68871,2,2
Job2,Q9Y6K9,O00327,1,1
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:**  
> The current input format supports a maximum of two distinct proteins per job, with the option to specify any number of copies for each protein. 
> Scalable modeling of complexes with more than two unique protein types is not currently supported in this repo.


## **5. Create AlphaFold3 JSON Input File**

This repository includes two helper scripts for generating AlphaFold 3-compatible input files:

> AF3_json_1seed.py

> AF3_json_20seeds.py

These scripts automate the preparation of input data for protein–protein complex modeling.
The scripts take a CSV file containing protein pairs as input, retrieve corresponding FASTA sequences from UniProt, and generate properly formatted AlphaFold 3 JSON configuration files for each modeling job.
Each job is created in its own directory within the specified working directory.

The two scripts differ only in the number of diffusion seeds used:
- AF3_json_1seed.py uses 1 seed abd produces 5 models per job
- AF3_json_20seeds.py uses 20 seeds and produces 100 models per job

> ⚠️ **Warning:**  
> This script submits **only protein complexes** to AlphaFold3 (AF3).  
> It is **not** designed for modeling other molecule types.

Both scripts perform the following steps:
- Read the input .csv file containing protein pairs to be modeled
- Fetch FASTA sequences from UniProt using the provided UniProt IDs
- Save FASTA files locally in each job directory
- Cache retrieved sequences in a CSV file to avoid redundant downloads
- Generate AlphaFold3 JSON input files defining model parameters and sequences


**Output Structure**  
For each job_name, the script creates a dedicated directory containing:
```
<JobName>/
│
├── <uid1>.fasta — FASTA sequence of the first protein
├── <uid2>.fasta — FASTA sequence of the second protein
└── <JobName>.json — AlphaFold 3 input configuration file
```
(The cache CSV file will be updated in place)

**Dependencies**  
Install the required packages using pip:
> pip install pandas requests

**Usage**  
Run the script from the command line or within a Python environment:
> python3 AF3_json_1seed.py

> python3 AF3_json_20seeds.py 

**Example data**  
The example CSV file **example_dataset.csv** is provided in the repository to illustrate the expected data format and facilitate testing of the script.

## **6. Prepare Your Working Directory**
To run AlphaFold 3 successfully, each modeling job must be organized in its own directory.
The directory name must match the job_name specified in your input CSV file.

Each job directory should have the following structure:

<Job_Name>/
│
├── <Job_Name>.json                              # AlphaFold 3 input configuration file
├── jobscript-alphafold3-step_1-msa_cpu.sh       # Script for MSA generation (CPU nodes)
├── jobscript-alphafold3-step_2-prediction.sh    # Script for structure prediction (GPU nodes)
└── parameters.inc                               # File containing paths and configuration parameters


All required scripts (jobscript-alphafold3-step_1-msa_cpu.sh, jobscript-alphafold3-step_2-prediction.sh, and parameters.inc) are available in this repository under the mpcdf/ subdirectory. No modifications are needed for the job scripts.
The only file that requires editing is: parameters.inc, where you must define the correct paths to AlphaFold3 , Model parameters, intput and output files and directories.


##**7.generate your parameterfile  **
This script helps you to generate your paramterfile for given only your inputfile. 
(TO BE DONE!)

## **7. Run Your Calculations**

This repository provides scripts to help you submit and manage AlphaFold 3 jobs efficiently on HPC systems.

**Single or Small Number of Jobs**
If you are running only a few jobs, you can submit them manually:
> sbatch jobscript-alphafold3-step_1-msa_cpu.sh

Once the MSA step is completed, submit the prediction step:
> sbatch jobscript-alphafold3-step_2-prediction.sh

**Running Multiple Jobs (Automated Submission)**
For large-scale runs, the repository provides two helper scripts:
- msa_af3.sh — submits MSA (CPU) jobs
- model_af3.sh — submits prediction (GPU) jobs
    
How These Scripts Work
- Must be placed in the parent directory containing all job folders
- Automatically iterate over all job directories
- Maintain up to: 300 CPU jobs (MSA step) and 300 GPU jobs (prediction step)
- Check job status every 10 minutes
- Continuously submit new jobs as others finish
- Stop automatically once all jobs are completed
  
Required Modification
Before running, update the username in both scripts:

>User running the jobs
>USER_NAME="<your_user_name>"

  
Running the Scripts
1. Start the MSA step:
> nohup bash msa_af3.sh > msa_af3.log 2>&1 &
  
2. After some jobs have completed the MSA step (wait a few hours), start the prediction step:
> nohup bash model_af3.sh > model_af3.log 2>&1 &

⚠️ Important Notes
Do not start the modeling script immediately after the MSA script
Ensure that some MSA jobs have completed before launching prediction jobs
Monitor log files (*.log) to track progress
